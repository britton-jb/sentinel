Params nesting per readme?
Null warning per readme?

Can I simplify the configuration piece?
Can I remove the permissions stuff?

- Trackable?
- unconfirmed access number of days

- Enable username rather than email based accounts

- Easy socket auth handling

- Swap guardian db backing from postgres to mnesia/dets?

## Cleanup

- Use with instead of nested conditional code
- Rather than util send error use render view
